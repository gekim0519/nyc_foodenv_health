# The relationship between restaurant geographical distribution and chronic disease outcomes in New York City

This year, a report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that Americaâ€™s obesity rate has reached a record high. New Yorkers are not so safe from the obesity epidemic, as more than half of adult New Yorkers are either overweight or obese. Studies show that the rise in the obesity epidemic is partly due to disparities in food environment; it is harder for some to eat healthier because their options are limited.

Our project intends to look deeper into the relationship between food environment in NYC and obesity rate along with diabetes rate and stroke hospitalization rate.
